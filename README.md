# Infinium_DNA_methylation_data

Code repository for analysis of DNA methylation data from the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChIP (Illumina) associated with my PhD thesis project _The Role OF Histone Lysine Methylation in the Regulation of DNA Methyltransferase Function_

Analysis encompasses several datasets from two human cancer cell lines, NCCIT and HCT116 with either:
- expression of histone mutant transgenes
- knockout of DNMT3A
- knockout of DNMT3B
